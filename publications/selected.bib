    This paper presents the input convex neural network
    architecture. These are scalar-valued (potentially deep) neural
    networks with constraints on the network parameters such that the
    output of the network is a convex function of (some of) the
    inputs. The networks allow for efficient inference via optimization
    over some inputs to the network given others, and can be applied to
    settings including structured prediction, data imputation,
    reinforcement learning, and others. In this paper we lay the basic
    groundwork for these models, proposing methods for inference,
    optimization and learning, and analyze their representational
    power. We show that many existing neural network architectures can be
    made input-convex with only minor modification, and develop
    specialized optimization algorithms tailored to this setting. Finally,
    we highlight the performance of the methods on multi-label prediction,
    image completion, and reinforcement learning problems, where we show
    improvement over the existing state of the art in many cases.

  abstract={
    Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) are probabilistic inference machines that admit
    exact inference in linear time in the size of the network. Existing
    parameter learning approaches for SPNs are largely based on the maximum
    likelihood principle and hence are subject to overfitting compared to
    more Bayesian approaches. Exact Bayesian posterior inference for SPNs is
    computationally intractable. Both standard variational inference and
    posterior sampling for SPNs are computationally infeasible even for
    networks of moderate size due to the large number of local latent
    variables per instance. In this work, we propose a novel deterministic
    collapsed variational inference algorithm for SPNs that is
    computationally efficient, easy to implement and at the same time allows
    us to incorporate prior information into the optimization formulation.
    Extensive experiments show a significant improvement in accuracy compared
    with a maximum likelihood based approach.

  abstract={
    Cameras are becoming ubiquitous in the Internet of Things (IoT) and
    can use face recognition technology to improve context. There is a
    large accuracy gap between today's publicly available face recognition
    systems and the state-of-the-art private face recognition
    systems. This paper presents our OpenFace face recognition library
    that bridges this accuracy gap. We show that OpenFace provides
    near-human accuracy on the LFW benchmark and present a new
    classification benchmark for mobile scenarios. This paper is intended
    for non-experts interested in using OpenFace and provides a light
    introduction to the deep neural network techniques we use.

    We released OpenFace in October 2015 as an open source library under
    the Apache 2.0 license. It is available at:

  abstract={
    QNSTOP consists of serial and parallel (OpenMP) Fortran 2003 codes for the
    quasi-Newton stochastic optimization method of Castle and Trosset. For
    stochastic problems, convergence theory exists for the particular
    algorithmic choices and parameter values used in QNSTOP. Both the parallel
    driver subroutine, which offers several parallel decomposition strategies,
    and the serial driver subroutine can be used for stochastic optimization or
    deterministic global optimization, based on an input switch. QNSTOP is
    particularly effective for “noisy” deterministic problems, using only
    objective function values. Some performance data for computational systems
    biology problems is given.
